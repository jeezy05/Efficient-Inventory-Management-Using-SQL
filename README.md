# 📦 Efficient Inventory Management System – SQL Project

This project implements a complete SQL-based system for managing inventory efficiently. It spans schema creation, data population, ETL processing, and deriving actionable business insights.

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Sample_Tables.sql` | Creates core tables such as `products`, `suppliers`, `inventory`, and `transactions`. |
| `Sample_Dataset.sql` | Populates the tables with sample data to simulate real-world inventory operations. |
| `Import.sql` | Contains data imports, integrity constraints, and foreign key relationships. |
| `ETL_ Dataset.sql` | Performs ETL operations – Extracts raw data, transforms it into structured format, and loads it into the system. |
| `Insights _According_To_Data.sql` | Provides business insights using advanced SQL queries (e.g., reorder alerts, top products, supplier performance). |
| `Deliverables.sql` | Combines all final deliverables such as KPIs, dashboards, and summary views as per business requirements. |

   2. `Sample_Dataset.sql`
   3. `Import.sql`
   4. `ETL_ Dataset.sql`
   5. `Insights _According_To_Data.sql`
   6. `Deliverables.sql`
3. **Review Outputs**
   - Use query results for business reports, dashboards, and recommendations
